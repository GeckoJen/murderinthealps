    <h1>Greta's Clue</h1>
    <h2></h2>
    <h3>
      Once her breathing has returned to normal, Greta tells you that she was just heading home for the evening, but as she was passing the sauna she heard loud voices arguing. She couldn't identify who was speaking or what they were saying, but one was definitely a man. Just as she passed by the window, she heard a crash, a scream and a thump. Peering in through the window, she saw Alyssa lying dead on the floor next to the snow shovel, and the door leading back to the chalet closing, as if someone had just run out through it. She called the police to summon you here. It was exactly 10.05pm when she heard the scream. You consider Greta to be a credible witness. The evidence bears out her story.
