    <h1>Carolyn's Clue</h1>
    <h2></h2>
    <h3>
      It appears from Alyssa's diary that Alyssa was having an affair with
      Edmund, her husband's brother. Did Brendan know about it? Did Francesca?
      This could definitely be motive for murder! Does that explain Brendan's
      shifty behaviour?
