    <h3>
      Murder in the Alps is a virtual escape room designed to test your crime
      solving abilities. A group of 6 friends were holidaying together at a ski
      resort, but late one night, one of them is found murdered. You are a detective with the local police force, and you need to
      interview all the suspects, and carefully sift through the information they
      provide to figure out whodunnit and whytheydunnit! <br /><br />A story
      full of intrigue and betrayal, it's up to you to seek justice for the
      murder victim and build a watertight case to ensure the murderer can't get
      away with it. Do you have what it takes to solve the mystery?
