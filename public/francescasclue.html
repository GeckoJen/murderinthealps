    <h1>Francesca's Clue</h1>
    <h2></h2>
    <h3>
      The document attached to Alyssa's email contains evidence of financial
      mismanagement and possible embezzlement, and pointed the finger at Damien,
      her work colleague and the husband of her best friend, as the most likely
      culprit.
      <br /><br />
      Finally, as you are leaving the chalet, you run into Greta, the chalet
      maid again. You ask if she had had much interaction with the people in the
      chalet in the days leading up to the murder, and if she had formed any
      opinion about them. She replies that they seemed like an odd bunch. “Three
      married couples and never once did any of them ever spend any time alone
      with the person they were married to!” she says. “I'd be prepared to swear
      that none of the married couples were together last night at 10.05pm
      either.”
