    <h1>Damien's Clue</h1>
    <h2></h2>
    <h3>
      Inside the CCTV control centre you discover some footage from a few days
      earlier, of Brendan and Carolyn behind the chalet, discussing the
      possibilities of divorce, and worrying about the financial impact this
      would have on them both. At one point, Brendan suggests that a fatal
      skiing accident would solve all their problems. It appears that this is
      what Alyssa had been looking at the day before, as the footage was already
      rewound to this point. No wonder she seemed a bit edgy when she spoke to
      Damien! <br><br> While you're there, you look at the CCTV footage from the night before at the time of the murder. There is no footage of inside the sauna or the chalet, obviously, but you do see a man and woman (though it's impossible to identify who they are in the dark) leaving the chalet and walking off together through the snow, away from the sauna, at 9.58pm the previous evening. The footage showed that they returned 25 minutes later. After leaving the CCTV centre, you go to see if you can still see their footprints in the snow. You succeed in finding the prints, and discover that the larger of the two sets is a size 8. However, following their trail, you establish that their path would have taken them far away from the sauna at the time of the murder, and therefore neither of this pair could have committed the crime.
