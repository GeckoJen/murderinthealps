    <h1>Interviewing Brendan</h1>
    <h2></h2>
    <h3>
      Second to be interviewed is Brendan, the victim's husband. He appears to
      be utterly distraught and claims he doesn't know why anybody could
      possibly want to hurt Alyssa. You're not sure you believe him, but you
      move on for now. You ask him about his shoes and he looks at you blankly.
      He says all the shoes for everyone in the chalet are kept in a storage
      locker by the front door, next to where they keep all the skis. There's a
      code to unlock it but he doesn't seem to be in a fit state to tell you
      what it is. You'll have to figure it out for yourself.<br /><br />
