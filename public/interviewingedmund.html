    <h1>Interviewing Edmund</h1>
    <h3>
      Fifth to be interviewed is Edmund. He admits that he was having an affair
      with Alyssa. He says it started after Alyssa discovered the affair between
      Brendan and Carolyn. He was providing comfort and one thing led to
      another. He says that he and Alyssa used to send each other coded messages
      so that neither her husband nor his wife would be able to read them if
      they happened to intercept them. You show him the coded note that Alyssa
      was holding when she died. Edmund looks astonished. He confirms that it
      appears to be written in their secret code, but adamantly denies that he
      sent it to her. There was no need to send notes, he explained, when they
      were staying in the same chalet. He says somebody must have cracked their
      code and sent a note to Alyssa pretending that it was from him. He tells
      you that if you can access Alyssa's laptop, which is lying on the coffee
      table in the chalet, he can give you the key to decrypt the message. You
      set to work trying to work out her password.<br /><br />
