    <h1>Interviewing Carolyn</h1>
    <h2></h2>
    <h3>
      Third to be interviewed is Carolyn. She seems uncomfortable and very
      nervous. She too says that she doesn't know who would want to hurt Alyssa,
      and appears evasive about answering questions. She does tell you that she
      knows Alyssa kept a secret diary, and that maybe you'll find some
      information in there. She says she doesn't know the code to unlock it,
      however, so you'll have to work that out first.<br /><br />
