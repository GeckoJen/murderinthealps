    <h1>Interviewing Francesca</h1>
    <h3>
      Sixth to be interviewed is Francesca. She says that she and Alyssa had
      been good friends, and denies having any prior knowledge of the affair
      between Alyssa and her husband. She appears convincing, though you remain
      skeptical if she was really as ignorant of the matter as she claims. She
      does tell you that Alyssa had been acting strangely in the days before her
      death, but she had thought it was due to some trouble at work. “She even
      sent me an email to keep hold of in case of emergency,” she explains. “It
      has a document attached, but it must have some sort of password protection
      on it because I don't know how to open it. I'll forward you the email if
      you like and you can see if you can open it.”
