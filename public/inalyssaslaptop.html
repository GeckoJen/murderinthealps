    <h1>Edmund's Clue</h1>

    <h3>
      Once in Alyssa's laptop, Edmund tells you that there's an encryption programme
      he and Alyssa use. Just type in the message you want to encrypt and it'll encrypt it for you. Likewise, an already encrypted message can simply be entered in and it'll decrypt it for you.
      Dead easy. Though somebody obviously had had access to her laptop at some point, as someone other than Edmund had figured out how to send an encrypted message to lure Alyssa to the sauna.

You also verify from credit card/pay per view records that Francesca was indeed in her room watching movies that evening - she just purchased a new movie at exactly 10.05pm, placing her most definitely in her bedroom in the chalet.</h3>
