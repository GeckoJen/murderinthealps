    <h3>
      You are right, the murderer was Damien. 
      <br><br>Damien had been embezzling funds
      from the company where he and Alyssa both worked, and she had figured it
      out. She was going to go to the police with her evidence, and Damien would
      have gone to prison. He couldn't persuade her to drop the matter, so he
      lured her to the sauna using the secret code he'd discovered that she and
      Edmund used, and killed her. We knew from Greta's evidence that the
      murderer was probably a man, as it was a man's voice that Greta heard
      Alyssa arguing with seconds before her death. Both women had alibis in any
      event - Francesca was ordering pay per view movies from her bedroom, and
      therefore it must have been Carolyn going off for the late night stroll
      that was caught on CCTV. The bloody footprints at the scene indicated that
      the murderer wore size 8 shoes. We know that Edmund wears size 10 shoes,
      because of the receipt we saw for new boots in Alyssa's diary. So the
      murderer must have been either Brendan or Damien, both with apparently
      strong motives. However, Greta's assertion that none of the married
      couples ever spent any time together indicates that it wouldn't have been
      Damien that Carolyn went walking with, but Brendan. Therefore Brendan had
      an alibi in Carolyn, and Damien must have been the one in the sauna with
      Alyssa committing the murder.
