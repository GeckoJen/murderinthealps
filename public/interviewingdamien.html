    <h1>Interviewing Damien</h1>
    <h3>
      Despite your desire to speak to either Brendan or Francesca about Alyssa's
      affair, you next decide to interview Damien, Carolyn's husband. It turns
      out that Damien worked with Alyssa at the same finance company. Adding to
      the intrigue you have already discovered, Damien informs you that his wife
      Carolyn had been having an affair with Alyssa's husband Brendan for
      several months. He says that Alyssa knew all about it, although she hadn't
      confronted either her husband or her best friend about the affair yet. In
      fact, he and Alyssa had had a conversation about it only the evening
      before. He had bumped into her as she was coming out of the CCTV control
      room, where the CCTV cameras for the chalet village were monitored. Come
      to think of it, he wasn't sure what she could have been doing in there,
      and she had been acting rather strangely. Maybe there would be something
      interesting to find in there? Sadly he doesn't know the code to the door
      lock though, so once again you'll need to puzzle it out for yourself.<br /><br />
