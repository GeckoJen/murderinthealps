  {
    stage: 1,
    evidence:
      "Murder victim: Alyssa; found murdered in sauna adjoining chalet.",
  },
  {
    stage: 1,
    evidence:
      "Potential suspects: Brendan, the victim's husband; Carolyn, the victim's best friend; Damien, Carolyn's husband; Edmund, Brendan's brother; Francesca, Edmund's wife.",
  },
  {
    stage: 2,
    evidence:
      "Cause of death: several blows to the head with a blunt object - the blood-spattered snow shovel next to her body has been confirmed as the murder weapon.",
  },
  {
    stage: 2,
    evidence:
      "At the crime scene: A trail of bloody footprints leads away from the body. Alyssa was clutching a piece of paper with a coded message written on it.",
  },
  {
    stage: 3,
    evidence: "The murderer's footprints came from a size 8 shoe.",
  },
  {
    stage: 4,
    evidence:
      "Based on Greta's testimony, the murderer was a man, who was arguing with Alyssa in the moments leading up to her death. Greta heard the murder occur at 10.05pm. Greta's testimony is borne out by the facts.",
  },
  {
    stage: 5,
    evidence: "Of the 5 suspects in the chalet, 3 of them wear a size 8 shoe.",
  },
  {
    stage: 6,
    evidence:
      "Alyssa was having an affair with Edmund, her husband's brother. Alyssa bought Edmund some size 10 boots on 31 Oct 2020, a week before her 34th birthday.",
  },
  {
    stage: 6,
    evidence:
      "Alyssa's best friend, Carolyn, was having an affair with Alyssa's husband, Brendan.",
  },
  {
    stage: 7,
    evidence:
      "Alyssa had most likely seen CCTV footage of her husband, Brendan, and best friend, Carolyn, discussing how convenient it would be if she died in an accident.",
  },
  {
    stage: 7,
    evidence:
      "An unidentified man and woman are seen on CCTV leaving the chalet and walking off together through the snow, away from the sauna, at 9.58pm the previous evening. The footage showed that they returned 25 minutes later. The larger of the two sets of footprints still visible in the snow is a size 8. Their path would have taken them far away from the sauna at the time of the murder, and therefore it is safe to assume that neither of this pair could have committed the crime.",
  },
  {
    stage: 8,
    evidence:
      "An encoded note was sent to Alyssa to lure her to the sauna at 10pm. The note purported to be from Edmund, but he denied sending it. Anyone in the chalet could have known how to replicate the code Edmund and Alyssa often used.",
  },
  {
    stage: 8,
    evidence:
      "Francesca was proved to be in her room at 10.05pm watching pay per view movies.",
  },
  {
    stage: 9,
    evidence:
      "Alyssa had left an encrypted email with Francesca, documenting evidence of financial mismanagement and possible embezzlement, and pointed the finger at Damien, her work colleague and the husband of her best friend, as the most likely culprit.",
  },
  {
    stage: 9,
    evidence:
      "Based on the observations of Greta the chalet maid, none of the married couples liked spending any time with their spouses. It seems a reasonable assumption that no married couple was together at 10.05pm the previous night.",
  },
